      <description>Technical Stack: Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
Analyzed air quality of India with data containing 6+ million records and 20+ air quality features. Utilized various types of data analysis techniques including outlier removal, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis to gain insights into air pollution trends and patterns. Identified a correlation (63%) between population and Air Quality Index (AQI), highlighting the need for targeted pollution control measures in highly populated states to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution.</description>
